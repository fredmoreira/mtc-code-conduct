MTC Code of Conduct - Minas Testing Conference
 
MTC is a non-profit event in which the main goal is to promote the experience exchange among Software Testers and Quality Assurance professionals in Brazil.
 
This Code of Conduct will be applied to all participants in the event in order to protect the audience against moral damages and dangers.
 
We dedicate ourselves to promote a respectful and harassment-free event for everyone. We do not tolerate any kind of harassment or intimidation from any participant.
 
No sexual, homophobic, pejorative and/or discriminatory image, activity or material can be used.
 
**By harassment is understood:**
 
Offensive comments, verbal or electronic, related to personal characteristics, racial origins, sexual orientation, gender identity, as well as sexual, racist, homophobic and discriminatory comments or images on public or digital spaces;
 
- Deliberative intimidation;
 
- Bullying;
 
- Persecution;
 
- Stalking;
 
- Photographies and recordings that may cause embarrassment;
 
- Repeated interruptions of lectures, chattering, in-person or online meetings, or any other event;
 
- Inappropriate physical contact or unwanted sexual attention.
 
 
It's expected that the participants immediately obey the requests to stop any kind of harassment or bully behavior. Be gentle with other people. Do not insult other participants. Behave professionally. Remember that sexist, racist or exclusion jokes are not appropriate to our event.
 
Any participant that violate such rules can be invited to leave, under exclusive criteria by the event's organizers.
 
If a participant expresses a harassing behavior, the organizers can take the necessary measures, from alerts to the offender to his/her banishment on other events promoted by the members of the organization.
 
If you get harassed, notice that someone is being harassed, or have other concerns, please behave in order to intercept or ask the organizers for help. We are sure that this politic will help MTC to become a more welcoming, inclusive, and integrative for everyone.
